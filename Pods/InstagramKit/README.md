InstagramKit
==================

A neat little blocks-based Objective C wrapper for the Instagram API. 

Built atop AFNetworking 2, it rips through the JSON asynchronously to give you ready-to-use Instagram model objects.

##Installation

#### Add Files to your project.

Getting started is easy. Just include the files from the directory 'InstagramKit' into your project and you'll be up and running. 

#### Cocoapods Podfile
```ruby
pod "InstagramKit", "2.1.0"
```
#### Instagram Developer Registration
Head over to http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/ to register your app with Instagram and insert the right credentials in InstagramKit.plist. 
If you prefer the Info.plist for all your app settings, you can include these keys in directly in your info.plist file.

## Demo

Download and run the Demo Project to understand how the engine is intended to be used.
